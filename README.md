# STM32 Examples
This repo is used to develop basic drivers for the STM32 peripherals that are used on the team. This repository is purely used for internal development and testing and shows basic examples of how to interact with the drivers. See the Telem repository for the Telemetry Board code. The end goal is to create a git-submodule for the divers.
